# Introduction
The game is called "Dodge the Creeps!". Your character must move and avoid the
enemies for as long as possible. Use the arrow keys to move the player. If
you're on mobile, tap the place where you want the player to go. When the start
button appears, you can either click it or press `Space` to start the game.
